# Summary
- Made use of Room Database for persistence as well as Shared Preferences for caching of searched terms. For UI, strictly native android UI widgets are used for clear uniformed code without unnecessary layout designing paramters.
- Made use of constraint layout and aimed for a monochromatic design suitable for Apple since iTunes API is used.
- Made use of Hilt for easier to read code by removing boilerplate di classes.
